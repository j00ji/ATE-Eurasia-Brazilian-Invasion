## Overview

This submod adds a new religion called **Modernism** originating from Brazil, centered on 20th-century modernist philosophy and cultural movements. Players can adopt this religion and specialize in one of three unique branches, each offering radically different gameplay mechanics and strategic bonuses.

### Features at a Glance

- **Religion System**: Brazilian Modernist faith with traits for different philosophical schools
- **Three Branch Traits**: Anthropofagian, Architecturalist, and Alternative Society paths
- **Brazilian Invasion**: Empire-wide invasion system (1800-2100) allowing Brazilian Modernist leaders to conquer the world
- **Brazilian Outpost Bookmark**: Start as a Brazilian explorer establishing a foothold on foreign shores

## The Three Modernist Branches

### 1. **Anthropofagian** (Cultural Consumption)
*"Those who consume the consciousness of other cultures inherit their strength."*

**Philosophy**: Based on Oswald de Andrade's "Anthropofagian Manifesto" - the consumption and absorption of foreign cultural elements to create something new and uniquely Brazilian.

**Mechanics**:
- **Feast Decisions**: Execute prisoners through special decisions that grant **piety bonuses** based on cultural and religious diversity:
  - Different culture + different religion: **50 piety**
  - Different culture: **25 piety**
  - Same culture: **10 piety**
- **Anthropofagian Holy War**: Special casus belli allowing declaration of war specifically to capture and consume prisoners
- **Advantage**: Rapid piety generation through cultural conquest and integration

---

### 2. **Architecturalist** (Structural Mastery)
*"Form given to function; beauty through order."*

**Philosophy**: Inspired by Oscar Niemeyer and modernist architecture - building grand structures and shaping the landscape through construction and innovation.

**Mechanics**:
- **Holy Site Bonuses**: Scaling bonuses tied to number of holy sites controlled (1-5 sites)
  - **Tier 1-5**: Progressive gains in:
    - Prestige and Diplomacy (+1 to +5)
    - Vassal Limit (+4 to +20)
    - Technology Growth (5% to 25%)
    - Building Cost Reduction (up to -15%)
    - Monthly Piety (+0.1 to +0.5/month)
- **Construction Efficiency**: Base -25% trait modifier to building time
- **Event-Driven Bonuses**: Automatic Holy Site bonuses triggered every 5 years based on current holy site count

**Advantage**: Long-term economic and infrastructural dominance through construction mastery

---

### 3. **Alternative Society** (Spiritual Journey)
*"Through revelation comes understanding; through understanding comes transformation."*

**Philosophy**: Centered on spiritual awakening and philosophical revelation through engagement with modernist thinkers including Raul Seixas, Paulo Coelho, João Guimarães Rosa, Mário de Andrade, and Clarice Lispector.

**Mechanics**:
- **Spiritual Journey Decision**: Undertake a philosophical journey to meet a modernist master (requires 100 piety + 50 wealth)
- **Three Revelation Paths**:
  1. **Journey of Expression** ? Master teachings on art and communication
  2. **Journey of Consciousness** ? Master teachings on awareness and introspection
  3. **Journey of Form** ? Master teachings on structure and transformation
- **Trait Rewards**: Upon enlightenment, gain permanent trait bonuses reflecting the master's wisdom:
  - Stat improvements (+2 to attributes)
  - Opinion modifiers with clergy and cultural figures
  - Personal skill bonuses (Learning, Diplomacy, Intrigue)

**Advantage**: Flexible personal development and philosophical growth

---

## The Trait Reset System

Modernist characters can use the **Purification Decision** to:
- Remove unwanted non-genetic traits
- Receive +2 to a random attribute as spiritual reward
- Cost: 50 piety + 25 wealth
- Cooldown: 5 years

Perfect for respec-ing between modernist schools or cleaning up negative traits accumulated through play.

## Brazilian Invasion (1800-2100)

### Overview
When a Brazilian Modernist character rises to sufficient power, they can trigger an empire-wide invasion of foreign lands - spreading Modernist ideology and Brazilian culture across the globe.

### Mechanics

  - Year between 1800-2100 (modern era setting)
  - Brazilian culture and Modernist religion
  - Global Brazilian invasion flag activated
  
- **Invasion Process**:
  - Coastal provinces targeted for landing
  - Brazilian Empire (`e_brazilian_empire`) granted to invasion leader
  - Automatic wars declared with **Brazilian Invasion Casus Belli**

---

## Design Philosophy

This submod prioritizes:

1. **Event-Driven Mechanics**: Systems use pulses and event chains rather than constant MTTH spam, giving players transparency and control
2. **Integration Over Duplication**: Uses existing systems (RIP torture, holy wars, holy sites) rather than creating parallel mechanics
3. **Thematic Depth**: Each branch reflects actual modernist philosophy, not just mechanical bonuses
4. **Flexibility**: Multiple paths to victory through different branches and playstyles
